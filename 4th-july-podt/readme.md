      ####  Count number of subarrays whoes product is less then k


      1. in my code file i have mention code of today's problem The title of question is " Count number of subarrays whoes product is less then k" discription of the questionn given below

    2. you have to find the no. subarrays whohave their product less than the given product k
    3.subarrays is a contiguous part of an array
    4.      Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
            Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

       Constraints:
       1<=n<=106
       1<=k<=1015
       1<=a[i]<=105
