         1. in my code file i have mention code of today's problem The title of question is "find triplest with zero sum" discription of the questionn given below

    2. in this question we have one array and we have to find is there any triplet present whoes sum is equal to zero if presnt so output true otherwise false we have to choose triplet (group of any three random elements from array )

    3.    Expected Time Complexity: O(n2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constrains:
1 <= n <= 10^4
-10^6 <= Ai <= 10^6
