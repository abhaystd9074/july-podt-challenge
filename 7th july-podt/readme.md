   1. in my code file i have mention code of today's problem The title of question is "merge two sorted arrays without using extra space " discription of the questionn given below

    2. given two sorted arrays in the question we have to merge them means all the smaller values upto the size of first array must i=be in the first array and another remaning elements must be in the second array we have do this without using any extra space 

    3.     Expected Time Complexity:  O((n+m) log(n+m))
Expected Auxilliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= n, m <= 10^5
0 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 10^7
